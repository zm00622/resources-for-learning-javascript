Follow these online tutorials in order:

Step One: Learn HTML: https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp

Step Two: Learn CSS: https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp

Step Three: Learn JavaScript: https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp

If the tutorials above seem hard or boring, then read the following book:

The easiest and perhaps the fastest way to learn JavaScript (and be hireable), is to simply complete this book: Head First JavaScript Programming - A Brain Friendly Guide

When I was learning JavaScript, I bought at-least 5 different entry-level JavaScript textbooks. The Head First textbook is by far the easiest to follow. There are programmers who have claimed to have been hired after merely going through this book.

Understanding the Bigger Picture:

Below is a road map to show you the path you need to follow in order to be a front-end developer. Here is a link to download the roadmap (i.e., flow chart) into a pdf:

The further you go down this roadmap on your own, the more hireable you will be.

In Person Events:

In person events help to build the network needed to be successful at this. By meeting and talking to other programmers, you can learn the lingo, find mentors and maybe even help someone who is struggling with something you have already learned!

Personally, I use Meetup.com, but there are other services like EventBrite, FaceBook Events and various blogs that specifically target the cities near you.

Here is the meetup link:
